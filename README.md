# Classical mechanics - elastics collisions

### Classical mechanics simulation of movement and collisions of particles (balls).

The script calculates movement and collisions of particles given their mass, speed, elasticity, gas(air) density, and gravity. Users can also grab the particles with their mouse and fling them around the canvas.
